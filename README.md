:wave: Hello and welcome to **Treasure_Hunter** code repository. A mystery game made using C language, which is playable using CLI. We did this project as a of our college's course. We also had to present this in front of our batchmates! :smile:

## Introduction

This is a mystery game in which you play as an archeologist who goes to an abandoned island in the sea of Atlantis and finds the castle of Anorak to uncover its buried secrets. The game is made using C language and does not need any other hardware requirements other than having a computer. The game has been further enhanced using visuals depicting a conventional cutscene.

## The Game

</p>
The game was designed to attract speedrunning. The timer starts from the first mini-game iteself. There is also an option to skip cutscenes to get better time while speedrunning. The game itself has four parts. With the player progressing each part, the difficulty of the next game rises. The four mini-games are:

- **Guess-da-word** : (did it before Wordle!) You guess a word related to the hint displayed. The word can be random (out of three). There are only limited chances in which you can get the answer right.
- **Word-search** : You have to guess the words present in the letter-matrix. These have to be programming languages. Don't try to be sneaky and put _C_ as an answer! Although it is correct but we have removed it.
- **Sudoku** : A simple 4x4 sudoku, nothing weird.
- **Crack-da-code** : Crack a 4 digit code in limited number of tries.

Complete these 4 mini-games and you have completed the game! The time at the end is recorded and saved in a `.txt` file as a record of all the players.

## How to play the game

The best part of this game is that you don't need any hardware objects, other than obviosly a computer (can be a laptop or a PC).  
To play the game, clone the repository and run the `TreasureHunter.c` program. We know it is a tedious way, but we couldn't come up with any other solution.

```
git clone <add repository url>
```
